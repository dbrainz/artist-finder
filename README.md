Awesome Artist Finder

## Description
Allows the site visitor to enter a performer's name and then searches Seatgeek for upcoming shows for that performer and searches Youtube for relevant videos

The free version of the Youtube API search that we're using has a cap of 10000 quota coins a day and each call uses 101 coins. 100 for the big initial search, and 1 for the second call that gets detailed info for each entry returned by the first search.

Uses : dayJS, jQuery, Bootstrap, YouTube Search API, Seatgeek API
